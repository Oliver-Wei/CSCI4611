# Assignment 1 (Text Rain) Worksheet

For the conceptual worksheets in this course, we'll provide a Markdown
template from the support code repository, and you'll commit your answers to
GitHub in the `worksheets` folder of your repository. If you're unfamiliar
with Markdown syntax, [check out this lovely guide provided by
GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) before you get
started.


## Background

By default, Processing uses the integer-based `0-255` convention to represent
colors. For instance, bright, full-saturation red is represented as
`color(255, 0, 0)`.  Processing also supports grayscale colors; black is
`color(0)` and white is `color(255)`. You may wish to look at the [color class
documentation](https://processing.org/reference/color_.html) and/or the
[tutorial explaining color in
Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/color/).


## Q1: Indexing

As mentioned in the assignment handout, accessing/setting pixel data via
Processing's `get()` and `set()` routines is a bit easier to code, but it's
much slower than directly accessing/changing a [PImage
object's](https://processing.org/reference/PImage.html) `pixels[]` array.
Processing stores a 2D image in this 1D array, so getting the proper pixel out
requires a little additional math.

In the code block below, write the equation for obtaining the index in the 1D
array from a (row, column) in the 2D pixels array. Keep in mind you can use
information from `inputImg` to help you.

```
PImage inputImg = loadImage("test.jpg");

int index1D = row + column*inputImg.width;
```


## Q2: Thresholding

The image processing technique known as *thresholding* will be useful while
creating your Text Rain. During the thresholding operation, if a pixel's
grayscale value is less than `threshold`, then it becomes black. If the
value is greater than `threshold`, it becomes white. You can use the green
channel of the color as the grayscale value.

In the code block below, write a Java code snippet for thresholding one pixel
(`inputPixel`) to black or white.

```java
final int threshold = 128;

// Returns: thresholded color (black or white)
color thresholdPixel(color inputPixel) {

    float g = green(inputPixel);
    if (g < threshold){
        inputPixel = color(0);
    }
    else{
        inputPixel = color(255);
    }
    return inputPixel;
    
}
```
